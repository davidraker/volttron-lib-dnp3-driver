# VOLTTRON DNP3 Driver Interface

A DNP3 (IEEE 1815-2012) master interface for the modular VOLTTRON Platform Driver. The protocol runs in a separate
[DNP3 Protocol Proxy](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/lib-protocol-proxy-dnp3) process built on the pure Python
[dnp3py](https://github.com/craigpnnl/dnp3py) library; this interface registers each outstation and its points with
that proxy, polls and operates points through it, and publishes the unsolicited responses it pushes back. No C
libraries are involved.

## Requirements

- `volttron-platform-driver` and `volttron-lib-base-driver` >= 2.0.0rc6
- `protocol-proxy-dnp3` >= 2.0.0rc0 (installed as a dependency), which brings `protocol-proxy` and `dnp3py`
- Python >= 3.11

## Quick start

Install the Platform Driver and this interface into the VOLTTRON environment, then store a device configuration and
its registry:

```shell
vctl install volttron-platform-driver --vip-identity platform.driver --start
pip install volttron-lib-dnp3-driver
vctl config store platform.driver dnp3.csv example-config/dnp3.csv --csv
vctl config store platform.driver devices/campus/building/der example-config/dnp3.config
```

## Device configuration

```json
{
    "remote_config": {
        "driver_type": "dnp3",
        "outstation_ip": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 20000,
        "master_id": 2,
        "outstation_id": 1,
        "control_mode": "direct",
        "read_mode": "class",
        "poll_classes": [0],
        "integrity_poll_interval": 3600,
        "unsolicited": false
    },
    "registry_config": "config://dnp3.csv",
    "interval": 5,
    "timezone": "UTC",
    "publish_depth_first_all": true
}
```

`remote_config` (the older `driver_config` key and its `master_ip` entry are still accepted) takes:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `driver_role` | `master` | `master` (or `client`) reaches the outstation below; `outstation` (or `server`) serves one to a remote master, see [Outstation role](#outstation-role). |
| `outstation_ip` (or `host`) | required for a master | Outstation address. |
| `bind_host` | `0.0.0.0` | Outstation role: the interface the served outstation listens on. |
| `port` | 20000 | Outstation TCP port. |
| `master_id` (or `master_address`) | 2 | DNP3 link address of this master. |
| `outstation_id` (or `outstation_address`) | 1 | DNP3 link address of the outstation. One DriverAgent per `(driver_role, outstation_ip or bind_host, port, outstation_id)`. |
| `control_mode` | `direct` | How outputs are operated unless a point says otherwise: `direct` (DIRECT_OPERATE) or `sbo` (SELECT then OPERATE; OPERATE is sent only when the SELECT echo accepts every control). |
| `read_mode` | `class` | What a scheduled poll requests: `class` reads the data classes in `poll_classes`, `integrity` reads Class 0, 1, 2 and 3, `points` issues range reads of exactly the polled points. `get_point` always uses a range read. |
| `poll_classes` | `[0]` | Data classes read by a `class` poll. Class 0 is the static data. |
| `integrity_poll_interval` | 3600 | Seconds between integrity polls, which refresh every point and collect buffered events. 0 disables the periodic poll; one always runs when the connection opens. A due integrity poll replaces the next scheduled read. |
| `unsolicited` | false | Enable unsolicited reporting of `unsolicited_classes` (default `[1, 2, 3]`). Events are published as they arrive (see below). |
| `link_reset` | true | Send RESET_LINK_STATE when the connection opens. |
| `response_timeout` | 5 | Seconds the proxy waits for the outstation to answer one request. |
| `reply_timeout` | 3 x `response_timeout`, at least 30 | Seconds this interface waits for the proxy's reply. |
| `registration_timeout` | 30 | Seconds to wait for the proxy process to start. |
| `proxy_group` | unset | All outstations share one proxy process unless a group name is given. |

## Registry configuration

```csv
Point Name,Volttron Point Name,Group,Variation,Index,Scaling,Units,Writable,Control Mode,Control Code,Notes
DGEN.VMinRtg,AI_2,30,6,2,0.1,Volts,FALSE,,,Nameplate Minimum Voltage Rating
DVVR.VVArCrv,AO_217,40,4,217,1,,TRUE,sbo,,Volt-VAr curve edit selector
DOPR.PermOp,BO_3,10,2,3,,,TRUE,,latch,Permit service
DGEN.WHrtg,CTR_5000,20,1,5000,1,Wh,FALSE,,,Energy counter
```

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Volttron Point Name` | The point's name on the platform. Required. |
| `Point Name` | The point's name on the outstation (an IEC 61850 object in a MESA profile). Informational. |
| `Group`, `Variation`, `Index` | The point's DNP3 object group, variation and index. Groups read: 1, 2 (binary inputs), 3, 4 (double-bit inputs), 10, 11 (binary outputs), 20, 21, 22 (counters), 30, 32 (analog inputs), 40, 42 (analog outputs). A blank variation takes the usual one for the group (g1v2, g10v2, g20v1, g30v6, g40v4). For a writable analog output the registered group 40 variation also picks the group 41 command variation (1 INT32, 2 INT16, 3 FLT32, 4 FLT64). |
| `Scaling` | Multiplier applied by the proxy: published value = outstation value x scaling; writes divide by it. Blank is 1. |
| `Units` | Units reported in the publish metadata. |
| `Writable` | TRUE for an output the platform may operate. Only groups 10 and 40 may be writable, except for served points (`Data Source` `server`), which the platform writes whatever their group. |
| `Data Source` | `short_poll` by default: polled on the device's schedule. `never_poll` for points that arrive only by unsolicited response; `server` for served points (the default in the outstation role), which are never polled. See the platform driver's documentation for the other kinds. |
| `Remote Writable` | Outstation role: TRUE if the remote master may operate this served point. Blank means outputs (groups 10 and 40) are, inputs and counters are not. |
| `Class` (or `Event Class`) | Outstation role: the event class (1 to 3, or 0 for none) the point's changes are buffered in for the master's event polls. Blank is 1. Analog outputs raise no events. |
| `Starting Value` | Outstation role: the value the point holds until something writes it. (Also accepted as `Default Value`, the master role's revert value.) |
| `Control Mode` | Per-point override of the outstation's `control_mode`: `direct` or `sbo`. |
| `Control Code` | For binary outputs: `latch` (default; true latches on, false latches off) or `pulse` (true pulses on, false pulses off) with `On Time`, `Off Time` (milliseconds) and `Count`. |
| `Default Value` | The value `revert` writes when the point has no clean value yet. |
| `Transform` | Accepted for compatibility with the discovery tooling; not applied (see below). |
| `Notes` | Free text. |

`interoperability.discovery.dnp3` in the interoperability service writes registries in this format from an IEEE 1815.2
device profile.

## Behaviour

Points are published with their platform type: binary groups as booleans, counters as integers, analog groups as
floats. A point whose quality lacks the ONLINE flag is reported as an error for that poll rather than as a stale value.
Unknown indexes, refused controls (the status the outstation echoed, such as `status NOT_SUPPORTED`) and link failures
are reported per point in the poll's error map; `set_point` raises on them.

With `unsolicited` true the proxy listens for events between requests and pushes them to this interface, which
publishes them through the driver's push path (the same mechanism as the BACnet interface's change-of-value
subscriptions): the depth-first and breadth-first point topics, and the device's `multi` topics, per the publish
settings in force. The base driver's `data_source` column is not yet wired to poll scheduling, so a point that
receives unsolicited values is still read on the regular schedule as well.

`Transform` and `Scaling` both describe the raw-to-engineering conversion. Scaling is applied by the proxy; the
`Transform` expression is not yet applied by any interface and belongs in the base driver.

## Outstation role

With `"driver_role": "outstation"` the device *is* an outstation: the proxy listens on `bind_host:port` as DNP3 address
`outstation_id` for the master at `master_id`, and the registry rows are the points it serves.

```json
{
    "remote_config": {
        "driver_type": "dnp3",
        "driver_role": "outstation",
        "bind_host": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 20000,
        "master_id": 2,
        "outstation_id": 1
    },
    "registry_config": "config://served.csv"
}
```

```csv
Volttron Point Name,Group,Variation,Index,Scaling,Units,Writable,Remote Writable,Class,Starting Value
AI_2,30,6,2,0.1,Volts,TRUE,,1,240.0
BI_0,1,2,0,,,TRUE,,2,FALSE
AO_1,40,1,1,10,,TRUE,TRUE,,100
BO_3,10,2,3,,,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE
```

* Rows default to `Data Source` `server` and `Writable` TRUE (`prepare_registry_config`), so served points are never
  polled and the platform may set any of them: `set_point` / `set_multiple_points` store the value the master will read,
  and the interface reflects the stored value into the equipment tree and publishes it at once (the driver's push path).
  `revert` restores `Starting Value`.
* `get_point` / `get_multiple_points` report what the proxy currently holds; nothing is read on a schedule.
* A control the master operates on a `Remote Writable` point is accepted by the proxy, stored, and pushed to this
  interface, which publishes it like a change of value and records it as the point's last value. Controls on other points
  are refused in-protocol (BLOCKED, or NOT_SUPPORTED for an unregistered index) and never reach the platform.
  Reservations on the device apply to VOLTTRON actors only; the master's writes are governed by `Remote Writable` alone.
* The master's polls (class 0 for static data, classes 1 to 3 for the buffered events, integrity for all) are answered
  by the proxy; dnp3py's runner does not transmit unsolicited responses on its own, so events wait for an event poll.
* On every (re)registration the proxy pushes its whole served table, so a proxy restart repairs the platform's values
  and a platform restart (which re-registers) repairs nothing yet beyond `Starting Value`: two-way seeding is the next
  step of the server-side plan.

## Testing

```shell
pytest tests
```

The unit tests need no proxy, platform or outstation. `tests/test_end_to_end.py` starts dnp3py's own outstation on the
loopback interface and runs the real interface, proxy manager and proxy subprocess against it; it is skipped when
dnp3py is not installed.
